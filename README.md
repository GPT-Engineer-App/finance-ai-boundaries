# finance-ai-boundaries

We are trying to emulate Pienso.com homepage.  The homepage features a bright green background with a white section in the center containing the main content. The company logo should read "Vela" displayed in the top left corner, along with navigation links for "About", "Blog" and "Our Companies" in the top right.
The main headline should read "Pushing the boundaries of Finance and AI." In the footer please include links to Terms and Conditions alongside Privacy Policy. Additionally add links to X and Telegram.
